<h1 align=center>Description</h1>
<p align=center>
PartyGUI is an improvement of the troubled development processes plaguing my previous works, such as PartyLib and the command line applications. Over time my approach to this project has changed drastically, with new discoveries to improve and innovate. However, the codebase often got mangled and buggy from these "hack fixes", and thus I've modularized the entire project and have hopefully settled on the final structure I like. This project is going to be the permanent and frequently updated version of the incomplete previous applications, and I apologize for rewriting this application so many times. Developing is hard sometimes!

Downloading framework overhaul

<h1 align=center>Usage</H1>
<p align=center>
The PartyGUI Avalonia build is not public yet, so stay tuned! Once it is in a non-buggy and usable state, it will be released on an alpha basis. If you are truly desperate to try it out, you can grab a bleeding edge build from GitHub Actions, although you'll need to download PartyModule separately and place it in the modules folder.
